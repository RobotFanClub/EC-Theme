# Everyone's Creative - Custom Micro.Blog Theme

This is a custom theme built as a test for migrating my newsletter [Everyone's Creative](https://www.everyonescreative.net/) off of Substack and onto [micro.blog](https://micro.blog/).

The theme is building off of my experience creating a custom theme for my personal site, [simonpeng.net](https://simonpeng.net), with new considerations in mind for trying to mimick some of the UX of the Substack homepage (and hopefully to improve it, too).

This is currently just a test, but I'm hoping to move it forward and bail off of the increasingly enshittified Substack ASAP.

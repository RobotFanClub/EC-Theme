/* This stylesheet is set up to help handle importing Substack posts into micro.blog.
Substack adds a lot of styling to the HTML that micro.blog doesn't strip out,
so in order to avoid having to edit every post, the theme uses the Substack classes
to do some styling. */


/* The substack_subtitle class gets added as part of the post, and Hugo can't treat
as a part of the post before the main content. The expected behaviour is for this to be
the copy under the post title, but that ends up with the post date and other dynamic info
put between the title and subtitle.

The current solution I have is to add the contents of this H2 into the Summary of each post
in micro.blog, which Hugo can work with to build the page and include this info. However,
this requires going in and deleting the H2 from every post, and adding it as the Summary.

I'm not sure if this is the best solution, so for now I'm just hiding "substack_subtitle" entirely.*/

h2.substack_subtitle {
    display: none;
}
